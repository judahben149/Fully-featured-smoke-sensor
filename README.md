# Automated Smoke Sensor
This repo contains the program code (Arduino) and design files (Proteus Design Suite) for a smoke (and LPG) sensor.

## Components
* Arduino Uno R3 module
* MQ-5 (Smoke) LPG sensor
* SIM 800L GSM Module
* 16 * 2 LCD Screen
* 4 * 4 Matrix Keypad

## How it works...
This project adds a layer of automation to basic smoke sensing by alerting the user of smoke hazards at the point of installatiom.
It alerts the user by sending an automated SMS and is open to be expanded upon to carry out some action on user's reply.

### Features
* The Phone number that the SMS is sent to can be changed right on the system
* The SIM card present can also be topped up with airtime on the system
